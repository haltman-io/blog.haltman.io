“Hello world” is the classic first message that developers write when learning a new technology. In this case, it's no different. This is my first post on a blog.

I never imagined I would have a blog. Personally, I know very few people who actually read what other people write on their blogs. Perhaps this range of texts, characters, and bytes will only serve to feed some artificial intelligence in the near future.

I already spend most of my time lost inside my head with countless thoughts of all kinds, ideas, projects, plans, but I rarely talk to anyone about them. Maybe, the only thing we really “have” here is our time. I recently heard somewhere that “we are always 5 minutes from the end.”

I decided to use my free time to share some of these thoughts here and allow other people to find them in some way.

Every Brazilian knows what a circus some Brazilian cybersecurity communities are. Let's not generalize, some communities are truly incredible, I've met amazing people in some communities who I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

But it's quite common to see futile ego wars that cause more disunity than development and unity within a group.

Any misinterpreted comment can be enough for someone to add your CPF (taxpayer ID) to the Brazilian health system's death list, so it's common to see that the most experienced people who have been in the field the longest always keep a certain distance, trying to go unnoticed. It's clear that this is full of digital gurus, like the infamous bestseller “**Técnicas de Charlatão**”. Well, it's even dangerous to comment on this piece of walking manure.

> Does anyone remember the legal threats this guy made against Julio Della Flora? I think Della Flora is running the Hardware Hacking course he launched at a well-known Penetration Testing training company here in Brazil, I haven't heard from him since.

We also have our “saviors” who publicly criticize the infamous bestseller. These same saviors who know only one phrase: “**BUY MY COURSE. 50% OFF**”

> Does anyone see any difference between these leeches who oppose “Bruno Fraga” in order to promote their own “miraculous hacker course at 50% OFF”?

I don't admire Bruno Fraga, I don't think anyone REALLY even cares about him, we just mention his name to get a few laughs. BUT, I feel disgusted to see someone worse than him selling himself as “the savior of hacking.”
